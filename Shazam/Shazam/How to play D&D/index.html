              We all know who's right here Mum, sorry. But what does the phrase
              "fantasy tabletop role-playing game" actually mean? Well, let's
              break it down a bit.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="fantasy">
            <h4>Fantasy</h4>
            <p>
              This one is, in my opinion, the biggest preconception (and usually
              misconception) people have about D&D. Fantasy often evokes J R R
              Tolkien's ideas of wizards in pointy hats, barbaric orcs, noble
              knights and a frankly lackadaisical approach towards hygiene, but
              in reality, it's so much more than that.</p> <br><br>

              <aside class="float__2 float">"One of the things I most love about D&D, and especially 5th Edition, is the freedom it empowers the players with"</aside>
              
              <p>Fantasy in this context
              refers to creating a world in your imagination that your game will
              take place in. The beauty of it though, is that the setting of
              this world can be anything that inspires you:

              >, the possibilities are endless!</p>
               <br><br>
              
              <p>One of the things I most love
              about D&D, and especially 5th Edition, is the freedom it empowers
              the players with to create their own world.           
              So you don't wanna play by
              Tolkien's rules? Throw that Silmarillion out the window and strap
              yourself in for some action on your terms! (Just make sure that
              nobody is walking past when you throw that Silmarillion, it's a
              big book)

          <div class="tabletop">
            <h4>Tabletop</h4>
            <div class="float__3 float"><img src="./Images/Tabletop.jpg"><figcaption>Combat on a tabletop</figcaption></div>
            <p>
              A long, long time ago in the heady days of 1974 whilst Charles de
              Gaulle Airport was opening in Paris and Abba's hit song Waterloo
              was winning the Eurovision Song Contest, Dungeons and Dragons was
              first published. It had been the result of years of play testing
              by Gary Gygax and his friends and they quickly realised that
              though the imaginations of players were huge, the physical space
              they had to play in was not. </p>
              
              <br><br>

              <p>This limitation in turn lead to the realisation that if
              they simply shrunk everything down then players could use
              miniature figurines to represent the characters they were playing
              and likewise miniatures to represent the foes they encountered.
              The action itself could take place in small dioramas made to
              represent the dungeons they were exploring, and it could all be
              small enough to fit on a tabletop. Anything could be used to fill
              in for these miniatures, once you had the rule book that was all
              that mattered, you could draw maps on pieces of paper if need be,
              imagination was the key.</p>

              <br><br>
              <!--(they also kept notes
              of their characters and their progression through the game on bits
              of paper called character sheets and this is why D&D is sometimes
              called a "Pen and Paper Tabletop Role Playing Game" and virtual character sheets from
              <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/" target="_blank"
                >D&D Beyond</a
              >)-->
              <p>The advent of new technology has meant that this tabletop doesn't
              even need to be a physical one anymore. Websites like
              <a href="https://roll20.net/" target="_blank">Roll20</a> allow
              players to build and interact with their dioramas virtually,
              removing the requirement for players to physically be in the same
              space (something invaluable for my group when lockdown first
              happened) So when we refer to tabletop, we are basically saying
              that the action of the game is small enough to be played on a
              tabletop and is done using miniatures that the players all
              control.

              <p>
              Unlike Gerard Way, when I was a young boy my father didn't take me
              into the city to see a marching band, but to see an amateur
              production of the nutcracker. Watching the dancers on stage helped
              me realise two things:
            </p>
            <aside class="float__4 float">"In Role Playing Games you toke on the role of a character, and you play that role"</aside>
            <ol>
              <li>I <strong>really</strong> didn't enjoy ballet</li>
              <li>
                I really <strong>did</strong> enjoy playing pretend like the
                people on stage were doing
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              This crucial realisation for my developing brain led me to the
              role of a lifetime playing rat number 3 in our school production
              of The Pied Piper of Hamlin, but crucially it also led me to
              discover the world of Role Playing Games. In Role Playing Games
              (RPGS for short) you take on the role of a character, and you play
              that role. You make decisions for the character, you define their
              goals and how they interact with the world, you funnel your
              imagination into them and get to play in a world completely
              seperated from our own. Basically you get to let your imagination
              run wild, and that is what I love so much about this game.

              <h4>Nota Bene: Expectations</h4>
              <p>
                In recent years D&D has garnered a much more widespread
                reputation with the dazzling success of shows like
                <a href="https://critrole.com/" target="_blank"
                  >Critical Role</a
                >
                and
                <a
                  href="https://www.youtube.com/c/dimension20show"
                  target="_blank"
                  >Dimension 20</a
                >
                and this has been absolutely incredible in welcoming even more
                players to this wonderful game. With this success though has
                come an unintended conseqeuence for players of all experience
                levels. I am talking, of course, about expectations. For people
                whose first exposure to D&D is through one of these channels, or
                one of the other spectacular live plays out there, it can be
                easy to forget that these people are professionals who make a
                living through the game. Often when I play I hear about players
                or Dungeon Masters (more on them in a bit) who feel almost
                intimidated by living up to the standards set by these shows and
                forget that at its core, D&D is a game, a game you play with
                other people, often your friends, and ultimately something you
                do for fun. Who cares if your idea of fun doesn't involve a
                character backstory that would put Tolstoy to shame? Or doesn't
                have your character speaking in a different voice? You're
                spending your time playing your game, play it the way you want
                to, in the way you've agreed with everyone else, in my opinion
                the sillier the better and allow yourself to have fun, that's
                ultimately what it's all about.

            Whilst the core concept of Dungeons and Dragons has always remained
            the same, that is to say it has always been a Fantasy Tabletop
            Role-Playing Game, the way that it has been presented has changed
            with time. <br><br> 

            <div class="float__5 float"><img src="./Images/Handbook.jpg"><figcaption>The Player's Handbook for D&D 5th Edition</figcaption></div>
            
            Once in a while the developers of the game realise that
            something has been missing from how they want the game to be played,
            and they throw the old rulebook out of the window in favour of a new
            one. Now please don't start throwing your hands up in the air crying
            "Oh woe is me! What is the point in learning this game if the rules
            change?" Because whilst the developers bring out a new set of core
            rules the old rules are not suddenly defunct. <br><br>
            
            Each of these
            different versions of the core game rules are called Editions, and
            old Editions do not suddenly become unplayable with the release of a
            new one, in fact, people still play games with old rule sets to this
            day,

              >this wonderful game that has been going on for 38 years</a
            >
            is run using the old 3rd edition ruleset because that is the one the
            players most enjoy. And when eventually 5th Edition is replaced by
            another edition, people will still be playing 5th edition games.

            <br><br>

            Each edition is a variation on the game, it's just a matter of
            finding the one you most enjoy. For myself 5th Edition is the most
            easily accessible and straightforward of all of the editions and is
            definitely the one I would recommend people try first who have never
            played Dungeons & Dragons before. It takes minimal preparation and
            rules learning and is in fact designed to be easy to pick up and
            play a game with, in gaming terms the rules are often called the
            "crunch" and 5th Edition is about as uncrunchy as they come.

          <h2>The Players</h2>
          <p>
            That's you, your friends, your dog, anyone playing the game because
            really, what is a game without players? Not a lot. An important
            thing to remember is that everyone who is playing the game is a
            player, and that includes the Dungeon Master. The Dungeon Master is
            the player who is running the game, but they're still a player. With that in mind let's
            dive into these two different types of players.
          </p>

          <h4>Players</h4>
          <aside class="float__6 float">"If the game of Dungeons and Dragons is a book, the Players are the pen writing the story"</aside>
          <p>Anyone playing the game is a player. Often in conversation though "Player" is used to refer to anyone who is not the Dungeon Master. "Players" are the protagonists in the story that you are all telling. Whether it be a sprawling epic or a thrilling crime solving caper what would a story would be without the characters in it? <br></br>
          <p>You will frequently have the opportunity to interact with other characters played by the Dungeon Master, and these are referred to as Non-Player Characters, or NPCs. How your character interacts with these NPCs is entirely up to you and forms the basis of social interactions in a game of Dungeons and Dragons. </p>
          <br><br>
          <p>Whether it be dueling a goblin on a rickety bridge over a deep chasm, or trying to flirt your way past the handsome bouncer into the night club, your actions drive the story. If the game of Dungeons and Dragons is a book, the players are the pen writing the story.</p>

          <h4>The Dungeon Master</h4>          

          <p>As I said a crucial thing to remember is that the Dungeon Master is also a player. </p>
          
            <br>

            <br>
            <div class="float__7 float"><img src="./Images/Turn_gif.gif"><figcaption>The robe isn't compulsory, but it adds a certain flair, no?</figcaption></div>
          <p>The role of the Dungeon Master is to build the world that the game will take place in, to lay out the challenges that your group of players will encounter, to play the role of every single NPC you encounter in your journeys and to arbitrate the rules of the game. </p>
            <br><br>


          <p>Very often, because they are running all of the encounters our heroes must overcome, it can feel like the Dungeon Master is playing against the players. This is not the case (well, hopefully not, sometimes you just have some mean DMs) Without conflict the story would be a lot shorter, and let's face it, a lot duller. The Dungeon Master will describe what your party must overcome, and then take the side of the obstacle that must be overcome, but they are not acting against you.</p>
            <br><br>
          <p> If, in my rather ramshackle metaphor I used earlier, you are the pen writing the story, the Dungeon Master is the narrator, an unaligned observer doing their best to tell the story in the best way they know how. In many ways the Dungeon Master has the most thankless and difficult task, so please, when you play, bear this in mind and maybe say a thanks or two</p>

          <h2>Characters</h2>
          <p>Inigo Montoya, Conan the Barbarian, Gandalf the Grey, Aragorn, all of these characters represent an archetype in storytelling, whether it be the swashbuckling Rogue, the brooding Barbarian, the wise Wizard or the stalwart Ranger and each of these archetypes will find their mirror in the game of Dungeons & Dragons.</p> <br><br>
          <p>When you first decide on playing a game of D&D you are also presented with the decision of what type of character you want to play. Each of the archetypes I have mentioned is split into one of the playable classes in the game, and you can further customise your character by choosing a specific race that you would like to play, perhaps a Human, maybe one of the bird-people known as Aarakocra or someone with the blood of devils running in their veins, known as a Tiefling? 
          The options presented to you can really help bring your character to life in your mind and this in turn can help you engage with the world of the game</p>

          <p>In Dungeons & Dragons there are 13 classes, each of which reflect a different type of playstyle. In alphabetical order we have:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Artificer: A tinkerer, a master of invention, using ingenuity and magic to unlock extraordinary capabilities in objects </li>
            <li>The Barbarian: A fierce warrior whose exploits in battle can drive them into a powerful rage</li>
            <li>The Bard: A musician who uses his music to inspire their friends and undermine their foes</li>
            <li>The Cleric: A champion of a higher power who wields divine magic in the name of their deity</li>
            <li>The Druid: A wielder of the power of nature, able to shift their form to become a beast of the wild</li>
            <li>The Fighter: A peerless master of armed combat able to turn their hand to any weapon</li>
            <li>The Monk: A master of martial arts, harnessing the power of their body and spirit to achieve incredible effects</li>
            <li>The Paladin: A warrior bound to a sacred oath, filled with power by their devotion to this bond</li>
            <li>The Ranger: A warrior who fights threats at the edges of civilization</li>

            <li>The Wizard: A magic wielder whose power comes from their knowledge of the world, and its limitations, able to manipulate the structure of reality</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Each of these classes are themselves split up into subclasses, which it would get a bit silly to list out in all honesty, but these can give you even more depth of customisation for your character. Once you have decided on the class that best aligns with your idea of what your character will be you then have the:</p>
          <h4>Races</h4>
          <p>Whenever I read a fantasy novel part of the wonder of escaping into the world the author has created is being met by the smorgasbord of diversity that is on offer. Populating the world with races of all different shapes and sizes is a joy, and I find my imagination is sparked by the opportunity to step outside of myself and explore the world through a completely different being. </p>
          <br>          <aside class="float__9 float">"Perhaps I'll play an elephant like Loxodon, a water breathing Triton or a minotaur of myth."</aside><br>
          <p class="text__1">With Dungeons & Dragons ever increasing popularity, more and more material is being released all the time and with this material come inspirations for more fantastical races for players to explore the world with. Perhaps I'll play an elephant like Loxodon, a water breathing Triton or a minotaur of myth. My love of Scottish folklore in particular was rewarded with the introduction of the Eladrin, elves inspired by the Seelie fairys that inspired Shakespeare's A Midsummer Nights Dream. </p>
          <br><br>
          <p>With all of fantasy to draw on, your character can be any race you choose, and 5th Editions continuing drive for ease of access for players gives you the rules to make your race and character playable any way you want.</p>
          <h4>Ability Scores</h4>
          <p>When making your character, one of the most important things to consider is: what are their strengths and weaknesses. Are they incredibly buff but rather dim (my favourite, though what that says about me I dread to imagine) or are they a savant whose time studying left little time for them to develop their body. Perhaps you fancy a dexterous rogue who gets knocked down by a stiff breeze? Dungeons and Dragons allows you to further tweak your character to match the image you have in your head through their Ability Scores.</p>
          <br><br>

          <p class="text__1">Ability Scores represent your characters natural abilities, and better Scores give a better chance of success. In brief Dungeons & Dragons character have 6 ability scores and they are:</p>
          <ul>
            <div class="float__10 float"><img src="./Images/Tomatina.jpg"><figcaption>Please do not throw tomatoes in your game sessions</figcaption></div>
            <li>Strength: How well can your character crush a tomato?</li>

            <li>Dexterity: How well can your character dodge a thrown tomato?</li>
            <li>Constitution: How well can your character stomach eating a bad tomato?</li>
            <li>Intelligence: A high intelligence lets you know that a tomato is a fruit</li>
            <li>Wisdom: A high Wisdom lets you know you shouldn't put a tomato in a fruit salad</li>
            <li>Charisma: A high Charisma lets you convince someone to buy a tomato-based fruit salad</li>
          </ul>
          <p>There are different ways to generate these ability scores that are outlined in the rule books for D&D but whichever way you generate them, it is always good to consider the type of character you want to play and to remember that sometimes having a weakness can help create a fully fleshed out individual just as much as having a strength can.</p>

          <h2>The Campaign</h2>
          <p>Whilst every great story requires characters to tell it it also needs a setting in which to take place. This can be a huge, galaxies spanning universe made up of all kinds of interconnecting worlds each one containing thousands of NPCs with elaborate backstories, or it can be a small village beset by bad luck with no great history to reveal, just an urgent problem that needs fixing.</p>
          <br>
          <div class="float__11 float">"What is the task that the heroes must complete?"</div>
          <br>
          <p class="text__1">The publishers of Dungeons and Dragons, <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/" target="_blank">Wizards of the Coast,</a> offers many resources to help spark your imagination when creating a world, as well as pre-written modules set in worlds that previous Dungeon Masters have built. I would definitely recommend looking to these sources for inspiration. As always though, your own imagination will provide the greatest source of inspiration, and will create characters and adventures that most resonate with you.</p>
          <br><br>

          <p class="text__1">Whatever setting your campaign takes place in, your Dungeon Master will have the unenviable task of creating this world for you, often requiring preparation and planning to help them bring the setting to life for the players and make everyone as a whole enjoy the game more. Once your setting has been established there is then the question of the story itself. What is the task that the heroes (or villains if that is the type of story you want to tell) must complete? Where will this task take them? Who will they meet on the way? What obstacles must they overcome? What is their reward? What are the stakes? These are just a few of the questions that should be considered and which will hopefully be answered in the telling of the Campaign and which, on the completion of the Campaign, the party will look back on and remember.</p>
          <br><br>
          </p>If I may return to my awfully worn out metaphor, if the players are the ink, and the Dungeon Master is the narrator, the Campaign is the story that they tell together.</p>

          <h2>Let's roll some dice</h2>
          <p>"But Ed!" I hear you cry, "if this is all just a storytelling exercise then why don't I just read a book?" Well, to that I have two responses, 1, how did you get in here? And 2, there is a third player in the game of Dungeons and Dragons, and I'm going to put on my little dramatic boy hat and say that this third player, is luck. You see another part of the game that I haven't even touched on yet, is the rolling of the dice. </p>
          <br><br><div class="float__12 float"><img src="./Images/Dice_gif.gif"><figcaption>Look at that beauty go!</figcaption></div>
          <p>You see in Dungeons and Dragons the way that you figure out whether your characters have been successful in overcoming the obstacles put in their path by the Dungeon Master is by rolling a dice. A player will state that they want to perform an action, such as persuading the surly innkeeper to give them free bed and board for the night, or to see if they're able to spot a pickpocket working in a crowd and the Dungeon Master will call for a roll.  The Dungeon Master will assess the difficulty of the task you are trying to perform, then they will secretly (or openly if they're being very dramatic) set what is called the Difficulty Class for the roll. A higher Difficulty Class represents something being more difficult, and a lower Difficulty Class represents something easier. "But Ed!" You once again chime to my utter confusion, "a dice only has 6 different sides on it, there doesn't seem to be much leeway there for different challenges" Well, that's where something beautiful happens</p>
          <h4>The D20</h4>
          <p>Ok maybe 'beautiful' is a bit strong, but in Dungeons and Dragons all skill checks (including attacks and spell casting) are resolved using a 20 sided dice, the D20. This means that the Dungeon Master has much more leeway in the difficulty that they can set for different activities and allows for much greater variety than simply using a 6 sided dice. That's not to say the 6 sided dice doesn't have its uses, but it's the D20 that is the real star of the show. So, a player states they want to perform an action, the Dungeon Master sets the Difficulty Class and the player rolls a D20. That, in essence, is the heart of Dungeons and Dragons</p>

          <h2>Further reading, and farewell</h2>
          <p>So, in a very brief framework, I have summarised Dungeons and Dragons for you. The rest of the journey is your own, finding a story that excites you, bulding a world with your friends and having adventures that very few people will understand when you tell them. But most of all, having fun, that's what we play games for, isn't it? There are more resources that can be found online to help you explore this world, including the official rulebooks for Players (called <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/rpg_playershandbook" target="_blank">The Player's Handbook</a>) and Dungeon Masters (called <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/dungeon-masters-guide" target="_blank">The Dungeon Master's Guide</a>) These would be an excellent next step for anyone excited at the prospect of playing a game of Dungeons & Dragons as they will give you a more in depth look at the rules of the game.</p>
          <br><br>
        <p>A great way to learn is to find like minded people and talk with them, there are Discord servers purely devoted to this purpose. There's also resources all over the internet where you can find answers to questions you might have about the rules, and <a href="https://www.5esrd.com/" target="_blank">this wonderful website</a> that has a more in depth look at how to run a game of D&D. I hope this crash course has given you some insight into the World's most popular RPG and has got you excited about the limitless opportunities for adventure that await. Hopefully one day I'll see you at my table! Until then take care and may your games be full of adventure, and awesome memories</p>
